# ML-Simple_Linear-_Regression-SLR--HR-Domain

HR Domain  salary predict

first domain selction 

1.machine learning 2.supervised learning 3.Regression

Using Mapping the phase of code

And import libray and assign the model creation 

Then, Input and Output slipt

And, Training and Test set Split

After model creation of import sklearn and using of evaluation of metrics

Use to R2 Square formula and actual to predict value pass the formula and predict

0 to 1 using it near 1 is a good predict ex(0.96,0.97)

Then,check the model verify and save the model

Go to the deployment and create a new file and load the model and used to keywords of file

And open the file use the input and predict the user want to output to predict
